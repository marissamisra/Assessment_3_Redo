                To quote Gandalf, "Not all those who wander are lost." Some might use the term "well-rounded" to describe me, while others might describe me as "lacking direction" or "irresponsible." I've always been inspired by Barbie's versatility, so it's unsurprising that I have studied child development, business, computer science, anthropology, and microbiology, as well as attending police academy and pursuing a career as an image consultant. My hobbies include cooking & baking (gluten free!), sewing, hiking, DIY projects, lifting weights and spin (#FeelGoodFam), and reading. I also have a family, but this page is about me. I'M THE STAR.
